# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS :

            In this Java application, we will demonstrate how to consume a public REST API (in this case, a weather API) and display the data in a structured format. The application will handle HTTP requests and parse the JSON responses to extract useful information such as temperature, humidity, weather condition, etc.

           For this example, weâ€™ll use the OpenWeatherMap API (a widely used weather service) to fetch weather data. This example will showcase how to perform HTTP requests, handle the responses, and parse the data using Java.
           
Libraries Used:
           
java.net.HttpURLConnection: This is a built-in Java class used to send HTTP requests to a REST API. It provides methods for setting request types, connecting to the server, and reading the response.

org.json (JSON-java library): This third-party library provides functionality for parsing and handling JSON data in Java. In this example, we will use the JSONObject class to parse the JSON response returned by the weather API.

You can include this library by adding the JSON-java (also known as org.json) to your project dependencies using Maven or by downloading the JAR file.

java.io: This package contains classes for reading and writing data (e.g., InputStreamReader, BufferedReader), which are essential for handling the input stream of the HTTP response.

java.util: This package provides classes like Map and List, which might be useful when you want to structure and store the parsed data.
